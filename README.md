# GSCE-Analytics-Project
Performed analysis using R on more than 100,000 data records related to schools and interpreted which factors influence the GCSE performance of disadvantaged students. 

This analysis seeks to determine which factors at school level contribute most to the GCSE Attainment 8 and Progress 8 scores of disadvantaged students by analysing the annual school performance and background information datasets between 2015 and 2019. Education institutions have a limited budget, and as such, it is important that this budget is spent effectively to maximise the GCSE performance of disadvantaged students. Information detailing the relative contributions of different environmental factors to academic achievement will help schools to prioritise their spending in a way that is commensurate with improved results. Even if the most influential factors are shown to lie outside the sphere of influence of individual schools, the results of this analysis may help to advise the implementation of government social programmes. The secondary goal of this analysis is to determine the efficacy of our models in predicting Attainment 8 and Progress 8 scores based on these factors. Knowing the Attainment 8 and Progress 8 scores for a year ahead of time based on a sample dataset may enable the school to determine the effectiveness of recently implemented improvement measures or to develop strategy for the following year.

The data used to conduct this analysis was downloaded from the UK Government School Performance Open Data Portal (https://www.gov.uk/school-performance-tables) and is available under the Open Government License. The data spans the years from 2015-2019 and shows the average Attainment 8 and Progress 8 scores for English secondary education providers, alongside key characteristics.  The datasets contain the following CSV files:

- 2018-19 England school-level background information dataset (e.g. schoolinfo_2018_19.csv)
- Annual England school-level absence rate dataset (e.g. abs_2018_19.csv)
- Annual England school-level pupils characteristics dataset (e.g. census_2018_19.csv)
- Annual England school-level teaching staff dataset (e.g. swf_2018_19.csv)
- Annual England school-level income and expenditure dataset (e.g. cfr_2018_19)
- Annual England school-level GCSE performance dataset (e.g. ks4final_2018_19)
